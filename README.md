# The Javascript Toolkit

 This is and attempt to organize the recent explosion of Javascript based technologies and frameworks into a coherent toolkit to be used by a web application developer.

After some time discussing and studying some of the technologies we'd like to include in this toolkit, we realized that more important that the tool itself, is the motivation that is behind it. The need it tries to satisfy.
